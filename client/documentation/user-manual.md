#### Keeper
 
The keeper tabs is mainly the same, except you have now the duration of the keeping, so you can adopt the cutie for a limited time only, without the disagreement of a life-long adoption, in case you want some free hugs during a hard week, or just want to be a great human being which doesn't like to see an animal alone in a flat.
On the top of the page, the search bar let you type informations, as an animal type, to filter the ads.
